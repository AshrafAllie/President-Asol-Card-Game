HOW TO PLAY

There are three phases in the game. The picking phase, the
swapping phase and the playing phase.

There are 4 players in the game namely Asol, Secretary,
Vice-President and President. President plays first then
Vice then Secretary and lastly Asol. Who ever plays the
Joker card last becomes Asol.

6's, 7's, 8's, 9's, 10's, Jack's, Queen's, King's. The
cards are shuffled and displayed face down. Each player
picks a card. If any of the players pick the same card then
they must re-pick. The picking phase is executed once only.
